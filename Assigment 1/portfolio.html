    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is David McIntyre-Garcia. I am currently a fourth year student at the University of Ottawa pursuing my studies in Software Engineering (https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/undergraduate-studies/programs/software-engineering). Ever since high school, I have developed a strong interest in programming
        and learning how to code. Throughout my years of leaning, I have gained a deep understanding on multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and C#.
        Additionally, I have gained valuable experience working with the Unity Engine. Besides coding, I am very passionate about playing guitar and making music.</p>
    
    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <p>I am currently taking a UI design course at the University of Ottawa (SEG 3125) taught by Caroline Barri√®re (https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/view/profile/members/3857?lang=en). The course consists of "Psychological principles of human-computer interaction. Evaluation of user interfaces. Usability engineering. Task analysis, user-centered design and prototyping. Conceptual models and metaphors. Software design rationale. Design of windows, menus and commands. Voice and natural language I/O. Response time and feedback. Colour, icons and sound. Internationalization and localization. User interface architectures and A PIs. Case studies and project." (https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/courses/seg/)</p>
    <p>Within the course, we are using both the NN/g (Nielsen and Norman Group) website (https://www.nngroup.com/) and the Medium website (https://medium.com/) as valuable learning resources.</p>
